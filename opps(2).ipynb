    "Clear Separation of Concerns: Abstraction allows developers to separate different concerns or functionalities into distinct modules or components. Each module encapsulates a specific set of functionalities and hides its implementation details behind well-defined interfaces. This separation makes it easier to understand, maintain, and modify individual components without affecting others, promoting modularity.\n",
    "Encapsulation of Complexity: Abstraction encapsulates complexity within individual modules or components, hiding intricate implementation details behind simplified interfaces. This encapsulation allows developers to interact with complex functionalities through a high-level interface without needing to understand the underlying complexity. As a result, developers can focus on using the functionality rather than worrying about how it is implemented, which enhances code reusability.\n",
    "Well-Defined Interfaces: Abstraction provides well-defined interfaces that specify how modules or components should interact with each other. These interfaces serve as contracts that define the methods, properties, and behaviors that are available to other parts of the program. By adhering to these interfaces, developers can ensure compatibility between different components and promote code reusability. Additionally, well-defined interfaces make it easier to replace or extend components without affecting the rest of the system. ''')"

Since components are independent and encapsulated, they can be easily reused across multiple parts of the system without modification. This reduces duplication of code and promotes a more efficient development process.\n",
    "Encapsulation: Composition promotes encapsulation by encapsulating the implementation details of individual components. Each component exposes a well-defined interface for interacting with other components, hiding its internal workings and providing a clear separation of concerns. Encapsulation helps reduce complexity and prevents unintended side effects when making changes to the system.\n",
    "Flexibility: Composition offers flexibility in software design by enabling the creation of objects with varying configurations of components. Different combinations of components can be composed to create objects with different behaviors or functionalities, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability in the system. This flexibility makes it easier to extend or modify the system to meet changing requirements over time. ''')"
